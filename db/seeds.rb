Starting with the ideas of elaboration and craft, they have been seeking ways to slow down the heart of their stories, add descriptive detail, use figurative language and enter into the hearts and minds of the characters to provide insights into how they are feeling and thinking while important plot points emerge. Following this stage, students will produce a final draft that they will type up, edit and finally arrange in their blank book.
