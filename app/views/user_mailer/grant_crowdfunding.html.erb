    <p>
       The Schools Fund has posted your grant for crowdfunding!
       You can send the email below to your class list and/or school e-tree, or have a room parent send it, if you prefer. It's a crowdfunding site, so it won't get funded unless people are told about it, but it's easy! You (or a room parent) just need to send an email to your class list or school e-tree.
      </p>
    <p>
       Donors can now pledge donations to your grant. If total pledges reach the crowdfunding goal, the pledges will be processed and your grant will be funded. We will notify you once your grant has reached its goal.

       To raise support, make sure to share your grant's page with your classroom lists, social media networks, and friends using this link: <%= @url %>.
